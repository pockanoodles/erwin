# Modules

Erwin's core is Today, Focus, Calendar, Tasks, Settings and the `/modules` catalog. Everything else is a module that each person turns on or off: today Courses, Ladder and People. The core works with every module off, and it never imports a module. A module adds to the core through fixed slots, listed in four registries under `src/modules/`.

## What a module is made of

A module is split three ways so the browser bundle never pulls in server code.

**The manifest** (`src/modules/<id>/manifest.ts`, listed in `MODULES` in `src/modules/index.ts`) is plain data that any code can import:

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `id`, `name`, `summary` | How the catalog names it. The id is one of `ModuleId` in `src/modules/types.ts`. |
| `defaultOn` | Whether it's on for someone who never touched it. |
| `page` | Its one entry in the rail: a path and the words ⌘K finds it by. |
| `sources` | The `Task.source` values it owns. While it's off, those tasks leave every list. |
| `linkLabels` | What a task's link says, per source ("Open in Canvas"). |
| `claimLabels` | What the goal form calls claiming every task of a source ("All Canvas work"). A source without one can't be claimed whole. |
| `adds`, `keeps`, `egress` | What the catalog tells a person: what it adds, what it stores, and everything it sends out of Erwin. |

**The browser side** (`CLIENT_MODULES` in `src/modules/client.tsx`) holds its components. Each is optional and draws only while the module is on.

| Slot | Where it shows |
|---|---|
| `command` | Its "Go to" entry in ⌘K. |
| `Views`, `Actions` | The top bar, on its own page. |
| `Settings` | Its row in `/modules`. |
| `Status` | One count in the top bar's status strip, on every page. |
| `FirstRun` | What Today offers before there's anything to rank. |
| `TodayTaskSection` | A section in Today's panel for the selected task. |
| `TaskBody`, `TaskContext`, `TaskPane` | Focus's work column, Focus's context column, and the task sheet's reading pane, for tasks from its own sources. |
| `useTasksLens` | What it adds to the Tasks page (below). |

**The server side** (`SERVER_MODULES` in `src/modules/server.ts`) holds what touches the database. The core calls these through `src/modules/hooks.ts`.

| Hook | What the core does with it |
|---|---|
| `jobs` | The background sync loop runs each one for everyone who has the module on, every tick. |
| `afterTasksChange` | Called whenever tasks are created or changed (`tasksChanged`), on or off. |
| `taskFacts` | Fields the module adds to tasks wherever the core hands them out (below). |
| `rankSignals` | What it tells Focus's ranking about tasks (below). |
| `claimKeys`, `claimOptions` | Keys a goal can claim a task by beyond its source and project, and the claims the goal form offers. |
| `proofItems` | Things it keeps that a boss can name as its proof, and how each one stands. |

Which modules a person has on lives in the `UserModule` table, one row per module they've touched (`src/modules/state.ts`). No row means the module's default.

## On and off

Turning a module off deletes nothing. While it's off:

- its rail entry is gone, and its page says it's off (`ModuleGate`);
- its sources' tasks leave the task list, Today, Focus and the scheduler (`visibleSourceWhere`);
- its jobs don't run;
- its API routes answer 409 `module_off` (`moduleOffResponse` in `src/modules/api.ts`), so a script calling them fails loudly instead of reading stale data;
- its top bar, status count and Today section don't draw, and its task facts, rank signals and Tasks lens aren't asked.

`afterTasksChange`, `claimKeys`, `claimOptions` and `proofItems` still run while a module is off, so its data stays consistent and turning it back on finds everything in step.

## How a module talks to the core

**Task facts.** `taskFacts` returns fields per task, and the core spreads them onto the task in `GET /api/tasks`, `GET` and `PUT /api/tasks/:id`, the Focus queue and the briefing without reading them. Courses adds the course, Canvas's submission state, the share of the grade, the grade if a task in danger is missed, and the material count. Ladder adds the goals a task serves. Writes to a task keep only `Task`'s own columns, since clients send whole tasks back, facts included.

**Ranking.** The ranker (`src/lib/erwin/rank-stage1.ts`) names no module. It reads three things a module can supply:

- `Task.impact`, how much a task matters from 0 to 1, set by the module that owns it (Courses: its share of the grade);
- `Task.closedAt`, set when the source closed a task without it being done (Canvas: missed, or the course ended);
- `rankSignals`: a `lift` from 0 to 1 for tasks the module vouches for (Ladder: the importance of a task's most important active goal), and `stakes` with a `stakesGroup` for the boost given to large work due far out (Courses: the share of the grade, within a course).

**The Tasks page.** `useTasksLens` is a hook that returns the module's lens while it's on and null while it's off (`src/components/tasks/lens.ts`). A lens can narrow the list, add tabs along the bottom, add sheet columns placed after a core column with their own sort, put a word on each task's row, add a control to a row's toolbar and a board card, pin rows above the sheet, and say which goal a new task starts with. Ladder's lens carries all of its goal UI on that page; Courses' carries the Mat column.

## The boundary

`src/modules/__tests__/boundary.test.ts` reads every import in `src/`. Code outside a module may reach it only through the registries (`index.ts`, `client.tsx`, `server.ts`, `hooks.ts`). `OWNED` maps each module to the paths it owns, including Courses' and Ladder's files outside `src/modules/`. A coupling that has to exist for a while goes in `KNOWN` with what will remove it, and the test fails both on a new coupling and on a listed one that's gone. `KNOWN` is empty.

Two rules keep the bundles apart. `src/modules/index.ts` and the manifests are plain data, safe in the browser, and `server.ts` and `hooks.ts` are server only. `src/modules/state.ts` has no Next.js imports, so the sync worker can load it.

## Adding a module

1. Add its id to `ModuleId`, write its manifest, and add it to `MODULES`.
2. Add its tables to `prisma/schema.prisma` with an additive migration.
3. Put its page under `src/app/(common)/` with a layout that wraps it in `ModuleGate`. Make its API routes call `moduleOffResponse` before anything else.
4. Fill the slots and hooks it needs in `client.tsx` and `server.ts`. If it owns tasks, give them their own `source`, list it in `sources`, and set `impact` on them if they have stakes.
5. Add its paths to `OWNED` in the boundary test.
6. If it sends anything out of Erwin, list it in the manifest's `egress` and in `DATAFLOW.md`.

People (`src/modules/people/`) is a complete small module: a page, its own tables, a job, tasks it owns, and a source goals can claim.
