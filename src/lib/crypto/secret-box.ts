 * GCM rather than CBC because it authenticates as well as encrypts: a value
 * tampered with in the database fails to decrypt instead of decrypting into
 * something we then send to Google.
 *
 * What this protects against: a copy of the database. A `pg_dump`, a Time
 * Machine snapshot, a stray backup — the realistic way these values escape a
 * laptop. What it does not protect against: anything running as you on this
 * machine, which can read the key out of the environment just as easily. That
 * is a real limit, not an oversight; closing it means moving the key into the
