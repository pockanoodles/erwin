/**
 * Encrypts credential columns on the way into Postgres and decrypts them on

 *
 * Deliberately transparent rather than a pair of helpers called at each site.
 * Erwin is a fork that periodically ports fixes from upstream, and the files
 * that touch tokens — the sync providers, the token manager, the OAuth
 * callbacks — are exactly the files those ports land in. Sprinkling
 * `encryptSecret()` through them would turn every future port into a merge
 * conflict. This way the divergence from upstream is two new files plus a
 * wrapper, and every existing call site reads `account.accessToken` and gets
 * a usable token, exactly as before.
 *
 * The trade-off is that these columns can no longer be searched by value.
 * Nothing does — verified before writing this: no `where` clause anywhere
 * filters on a credential — and it is inherent to encrypting with a random IV
 * rather than a property of this implementation.
 *
 * Transformation is model-aware and follows relations to any depth, because
 * most callers read a credential through an `include` rather than directly.
 * See `relationsFor` below for why that matters.

 * there is no NextAuth database adapter, so its `access_token` /
 * `refresh_token` columns stay empty — the live integration tokens live in

 *
 * `User.passwordHash` is absent for a different reason: it is a bcrypt hash,
 * which needs no encryption, and encrypting it would break `compare()`.

/**
 * Relation field -> related model, per model, from Prisma's own datamodel.
 *
 * This is what makes the extension work at depth. A credential is very often
 * read through a relation rather than directly:
 *
 *   prisma.calendarFeed.findUnique({ ..., include: { account: true } })
 *
 * Here the operation's model is `CalendarFeed`, which owns no credentials, so
 * a model-name-only check sees nothing to do and hands back a *ciphertext*
 * `account.accessToken` — which then gets sent to the provider as the
 * password. Fifteen call sites read credentials this way, and CalDAV failed
 * exactly like that: 401, the error swallowed by a `catch` that returns an
 * empty event list, and a sync that reported success after having already
 * deleted the feed's events.
 *
 * Deriving the map from `Prisma.dmmf` rather than hand-listing relations means
 * a new relation to a credential-bearing model is covered the day it is added.
 *
 * Built on first use, not at import. This module reaches the client bundle —
 * the extension is attached where the Prisma singleton is created, and that
 * module is pulled in transitively by client code — and `@prisma/client`
 * resolves to a browser stub there whose `Prisma.dmmf` is `undefined` while
 * `Prisma.defineExtension` still exists. Reading `.datamodel` at module scope
 * therefore threw during hydration and took down every page with
 * "a client-side exception has occurred". Nothing in the browser ever calls a
 * query, so deferring the read costs nothing and keeps the import inert.
