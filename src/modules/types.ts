/**
 * A module is an optional part of Erwin that each person turns on or off on
 * /modules. The core (Today, Focus, Calendar, Tasks) works without any of
 * them; a module adds to the core through fixed slots, and the core never
 * reaches into a module.
 *
 * Each module is split in three so the browser bundle never pulls in server
 * code: `manifest.ts` is plain data and safe anywhere, its components are
 * listed in `src/modules/client.tsx`, and its jobs and ranking hooks in
 * `src/modules/server.ts`.
