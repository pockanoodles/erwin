/**
 * One-time backfill: encrypt the credential columns that were written before
 * encryption existed.
 *
 * Deliberately uses an **unextended** Prisma client and calls `encryptSecret`
 * itself, rather than reading and rewriting through the extension. Going
 * through the extension would mean reading a value, decrypting it, and
 * re-encrypting it — which works, but makes the script's effect depend on the
 * very layer it is migrating for. Reading the raw column and writing a raw
 * value keeps what this does visible.
 *
 * Safe to re-run: already-encrypted values are counted and skipped, never
 * double-wrapped.
 *
 *   npm run credentials:encrypt -- --dry-run   # report only
 *   npm run credentials:encrypt                # write
